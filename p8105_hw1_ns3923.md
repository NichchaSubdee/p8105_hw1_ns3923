## Problem 1

This problem uses inline R, plotting, and shows how `ggplot` behaves
with different variable types. I first load the necessary packages.

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
```

Then, we will load the `early_january_weather` dataset for further
analysis.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Next, we would like to know the variables and the size of the dataset
and the mean temperature. We can use the following code to do so.

``` r
# The variables in this dataset: Names and values
names(early_january_weather)
?early_january_weather

# The size of the dataset as numbers of rows and columns, respectively
nrow(early_january_weather)
ncol(early_january_weather)

# The mean temperature in 2 decimal points
round(mean(early_january_weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE),2)
```
