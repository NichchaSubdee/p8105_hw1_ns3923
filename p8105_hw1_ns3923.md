## Problem 1

This problem uses inline R, plotting, and shows how `ggplot` behaves
with different variable types. I first load the necessary packages.

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
```

Then, we will load the `early_january_weather` dataset, which contains
hourly meteorological data for LGA, JFK, and EWR for January 2013.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Next, we would like to know the variables and the size of the dataset
and the mean temperature. We can use the following code to do so.

``` r
# The variables in this dataset: Names and values
names(early_january_weather)
?early_january_weather

# The size of the dataset as numbers of rows and columns, respectively
nrow(early_january_weather)
ncol(early_january_weather)

# The mean temperature in 2 decimal points
round(mean(early_january_weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE),2)
```

**Discussion**

The dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns.

There are **15 variables**: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp,
humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour

The variable `origin` indicates the airport weather station. Temperature
(`temp`) and dewpoint (`dewp`) are recorded in degrees Fahrenheit, with
a mean temperature of **39.58 Â°F.** Other important variables include
wind direction (`wind_dir`, in degrees), wind speed and gust
(`wind_speed`,`wind_gust`, in mph), precipitation (`precip`, in inches),
sea level pressure (`pressure`, in millibars), and date and hour of the
recording (`time_hour`).
