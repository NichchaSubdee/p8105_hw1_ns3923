## Problem 1
This problem uses inline R, plotting, and shows how `ggplot` behaves with different variable types. I first load the necessary packages.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
```

Then, we will load the `early_january_weather` dataset, which contains hourly meteorological data for LGA, JFK, and EWR for January 2013.

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```

Next, we would like to know the variables and the size of the dataset and the mean temperature. We can use the following code to do so.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# The variables in this dataset: Names and values
names(early_january_weather)
?early_january_weather

# The size of the dataset as numbers of rows and columns, respectively
nrow(early_january_weather)
ncol(early_january_weather)

# The mean temperature in 2 decimal points
round(mean(early_january_weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE),2)
```
**Discussion**

The dataset has `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.  

There are **15 variables**: `r names(early_january_weather)`

**Some important variables**
- `origin` = 


The mean temperature (temp) is `r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE),2)` Â°F.
